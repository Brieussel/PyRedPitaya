How to install PyRedpitaya in a redpitaya:

first download from github (https://github.com/Brieussel/PyRedPitaya/tree/master/python)
the file PyRedPitaya-1.0

go in the file PyRedPitaya-1.0/monitor

and execute the commande make (you need gcc)

to build libmonitor.so which is used to communicate with the register.


Then make sure you can connect to your redpitaya:
Connect your redpitaya to the network (or to the internet box) with an internet cable
and connect to it with your computer:


ssh root@134.31.130.180
password=root


You will have to use the IP adress of your redpitaya (it is written on it)


in an other terminal in the file PyRedPitaya-1.0

scp -r *  root@134.31.130.180:/home/test/PyRedPitaya/

to copy all the files to your redpitaya

in the other terminal (connected by ssh to the redpitaya)

sudo apt-get install pip3

pip3 numpy
pip3 install myhdl
pip3 install rpyc
pip3 install cached_property


cd /home/test/PyRedPitaya/

python3 setup.py install


now the package PyRedPitaya should be installed in /usr/lib/python3.5 (in the redpitaya)



we can test it:

ipython3

from PyRedPitaya.board import RedPitaya

redpitaya = RedPitaya()

print redpitaya.ams.temp # Read property
redpitaya.hk.led = 0b10101010 # Write property


it should work in any directory of the redpitaya or it means that the installation of PyRedPitaya is not done correctly
 
then you need to start the rpyc link:


 python3 /usr/local/bin/rpyc_classic.py

you should obtain something like: INFO:SLAVE/18812:server started on [0.0.0.0]:18812

the number 18812 is the connection port, that you will need to use.

now let this terminal open in the background (or you will close the connection) and

from your computer 

sudo apt-get install pip3 

pip3 numpy
pip3 install myhdl
pip3 install rpyc
pip3 install cached_property

to install all the packaging

go in the folder:

PyRedPitaya-1.0/



and try:



ipython3

import rpyc

conn = rpyc.classic.connect("134.31.130.180", port=18812)

from PyRedPitaya.pc import RedPitaya

redpitaya = RedPitaya(conn)


redpitaya.hk.led = 0b10101010 # Write property
print (redpitaya.ams.temp) # Read property


from time import sleep

from pylab import *

redpitaya.scope.setup(frequency = 100, trigger_source=1)

sleep(100E-3)

plot(redpitaya.scope.times, redpitaya.scope.data_ch1)

show()

 


you have to use the ip address of your redpitaya and the port open by rpyc



Hope this will help some people
